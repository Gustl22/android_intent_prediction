\chapter{Methodology}

\todo{Describe methodology}
Start with your overall approach to the research.
What research problem or question did you investigate?
What type of data did you need to answer it?
Quantitative, qualitative, or mixed? Primary or secondary? Experimental or descriptive?

\section{Data Aquisition}
How you collected and analyzed your data
Describe the specific methods you used for data collection and analysis.
How did you collect and analyze your data?
What tools or materials did you use?
How did you ensure the quality and accuracy of your data?

- Why RICO, rather use a dataset with accessibility service.
- ERICA employs a human-powered approach over an automated one:
    - More realistic results
    - required user input, which cannot emulated, Google Captcha, real data
    - humans detect the completion of UI updates \cite{deka2016erica}
    - erica is quite outdated


Any tools or materials you used in the research.
The type of research you conducted

E.g. Google Scholar, Google Research, Tensorflow, Keras, Udemy, Open Source, Reproducible

\section{Methodological variety}
Explain why you chose these methods over others.
How do they relate to your research question and literature review?
How do they address the limitations or gaps in existing research?
How do they suit your research design and objectives?

- No similar approach
- No dataset present with consecutive sequential app usages
- Many different approaches to solve this problem:
    - Encoder, Decoder, etc...
- A Study can follow

\section{Methodological choices}
Evaluate and justify your methodological choices.
Why you chose these methods
How did they affect the outcome of your research?
What challenges or difficulties did you encounter and how did you overcome them?
How can you ensure the credibility and generalizability of your findings?


\todo{overall goal is more than just interaction traces}
Goal: Make the algorithm as independent of the data as possible.
Find general rules to feed the data.
Applicable to other research fields, not just UI traces.
Use LSTM, so predict something unseen, in contrast to RICO or ERICA, which only categorize the current context


\section{Research Biases}
How you mitigated or avoided research biases
