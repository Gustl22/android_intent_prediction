\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This is a typical human-computer interaction thesis structure for an introduction which is structured in four paragraphs as follows:
% First Paragraph
% CORE MESSAGE OF THIS PARAGRAPH:

\section{Necessarity of Vectors for Android UI}

Motivation for transforming Android UI tree data to vectors

- Low Button depth: number of clicks until one gets to the action \cite{lee2018click}

Contributions: \cite{zhou2021large}
• An analysis of a large-scale dataset of mobile user click se-
quences that reveals rich factors and complexity in modeling
click behaviors, which contributes new knowledge to under-
stand mobile interaction behaviors.
• A Transformer-based deep model that predicts next element
to click based on the user click history and the current screen
and time. The model does not rely on a vocabulary of prede-
fined UI elements and provides a general solution for model-
ing arbitrary UI elements for click prediction.
• A thorough experiment that compares our deep model with
multiple alternative designs and baseline models, and an
analysis of model behaviors and benefits that the model can
bring to improve mobile interaction.
