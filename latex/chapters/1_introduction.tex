%\todo{Explain how many time a user spents on a mobile device, facilitate steps, make it more productive, qualitative user experience}
The interaction of a user with an end device such as a smartphone or a computer is very diverse and difficult to contextualize.
Nevertheless, user-specific (personalized) as well as global (collaborative) patterns can possibly be worked out with the help of preceding user interactions and screen contents.
These could be used to predict the intention, such as the action or the motivation of a user or a group of users.
Especially the level of detail, at which these predictions can be made, is an integral part of offering a reliable service.
By making use of the continuous on-device data, the users behavior can be worked out and be used to forecast their next actions.
These can then be very coarse, such as predicting the next app.
Or they can be very detailed, e.g.\ determining the next user action, such as filling out a form field or selecting the favorite meal in the delivery service app.

\section{The Role of Intent Prediction}
\label{sec:role-intent-prediction}

The term \ti{intent} can have ambiguous meanings and can be used in different context.
In the dictionary it is described as the fact of intending something, so it is planned to do~\cite{dictionaryIntent}.
Generally we can assume that intent is a stronger desire to accomplish ones intention.
Kofler and Hanjalic et al.~\cite{kofler2016user} also describe the intent as \quotes{immediate reason, purpose, or goal [\ldots] that motivates a user to} act.

The aim or purpose must be differentiated from the actual user input, also known as interaction.
So the intent can be seen as the preliminary stage of interaction.
Gestures and click sequences then are the concrete actions, and might fulfill a (small) part of the users intent.
Therefore, in this work it is not the goal to obtain the users full intent, but to work out factors, such as user inputs or gestures, which hint to the intent of the user.
Further, \ti{prediction} describes that the intent or factors of intent should be available (calculated) before they have actually happened or were measured.

\section{Necessity of Vectors for Android UI}
\label{sec:necessity-of-vectors-for-android-ui}
%Motivation for transforming Android UI tree data to vectors

A vector is a mathematical construct, which can hold a list of numbers, and it is also a special form of a tensor.
Vectorizing an object means, representing the object in a concise form and ensuring to transfer certain features or meanings.
In this context, vectorization is a tool to embed objects in a (small) binary package, which then can perform certain actions in an artificial environment.
Most of the time in this thesis vectorization is referred to as embedding or the result of a trained model.

The Android \gls{os} produces a big amount of data in every user session.
To be able to process such an amount of these traces, it is helpful to save these in a small form factor, such as an embedding.


% Zusammenfassen in die wichtigste Aussage: machine learning ist spannend für die Vorhersage weil es Usergruppen erstellt, die sensiblen Daten rausgefiltert werden und ....?
Furthermore, such a technology provides many benefits in addition to intent prediction.
The complexity and the size of a \gls{ui} tree can be reduced by vectorizing them.
User groups can be worked out in social studies, which have a similar behavior when using digital \gls{ui} systems \cite{jayarajah2015need}.
Also, the technical expertise on individual features can be eliminated, that would be required to manually compare user sessions \cite{ghods2019activity2vec}.
A users smartphone usage history can be saved or compared, considering the aspect of avoiding saving personal information.
App developers can be supported to improve their app design and usability.
It may be applied in psychology and market research or help detecting addictions.
On a technical side the method can optimize preloading of processes on mobile devices, which results in energy savings \cite{shen2019deepapp}.
As shown, many fields of application can profit by elaborating such a system.
It would be exciting to know, how the concrete concept would look like and if it can be implemented successfully e.g. to improve the user experience on end-user devices.

For this purpose, the Android \gls{ui} of the device can be tracked, and relevant information are collected.
After a few preprocessing steps, the data can be trained with a \gls{ml} model to acquire the user behaviors and then make predictions, if convenient for the user.

        Possible procedure using a Machine-Learning algorithm to predict the next intent from a beginning user session:
        The input (1) can be a sequence of Android tree data.
        With help of a Machine-Learning-Model (2) (e.g. RNN) a vector representation (embedding) can be trained and then predict the most probable action or screen (3) from a given starting sequence, but also can be improved through the users feedback with reinforcement learning.
    }

\end{figure}

A guideline and a proof-of concept will be developed on how a model for predicting user intent could be built.
To this end, possibilities for collecting and vectorizing sequential UI trees (e.g., from the Android Accessibility Service) will be discussed.
The performance of the model can be measured, for example, by indicators such as the amount of training data and time spent on the learning process.

The thesis is aimed to contribute in the following way.
Criteria on dataset for Android UI embeddings are given.
A proof-of-concept is shown, how a multidimensional flexible intent prediction model can be designed and,
an overview of methods and models is given, which can help deciding which model is suited for Android intention prediction.

In computer science there often coexists multiple (correct) solutions to the same problem.
Many technologies have the capabilities of achieving a similar result, but are specialized in the one or the other way.
That led to the question of \ti{what a suitable model for the prediction of user intent} can be.

Also, the term \quotes{user intent} is not defined exactly.
A prediction can be made in different contexts.
That raises the question \ti{at what level of detail the intent predictions can be made?}
