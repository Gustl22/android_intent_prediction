\section{Necessarity of Vectors for Android UI}

Motivation for transforming Android UI tree data to vectors

- open source code for predicting next user click / action
- evaluate and compare existing approaches
- provide tools to reduce screen sequences to vectors
- how to work with multidimensional (multi-modal) data in RNNs

- Low Button depth: number of clicks until one gets to the action \cite{lee2018click}

- Explain intent, and the other words in the title

Contributions: \cite{zhou2021large}
• An analysis of a large-scale dataset of mobile user click se-
quences that reveals rich factors and complexity in modeling
click behaviors, which contributes new knowledge to under-
stand mobile interaction behaviors.
• A Transformer-based deep model that predicts next element
to click based on the user click history and the current screen
and time. The model does not rely on a vocabulary of prede-
fined UI elements and provides a general solution for model-
ing arbitrary UI elements for click prediction.
• A thorough experiment that compares our deep model with
multiple alternative designs and baseline models, and an
analysis of model behaviors and benefits that the model can
bring to improve mobile interaction.

Contributions: \cite{screen2vec}
Screen2Vec: a new self-supervised technique for generating
more comprehensive semantic embeddings of GUI screens
and components using their textual content, visual design
and layout patterns, and app meta-data.
(2) An open-sourced GUI embedding model trained using the
Screen2Vec technique on the Rico [9] dataset that can be
used off-the-shelf.
(3) Several sample downstream tasks that showcase the model’s
usefulness.
