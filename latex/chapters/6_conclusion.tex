Future directions for research in this area

ChatGPT – Image Recognition – Limitation als Ausblick

Generate Dataset which overcomes the limitations

Make a study with actual feedback on a prediction system, visualization
-> Learn faster and directly, Reinforced learning

Work out user flows, like in ERICA, but without the need to separate it from the interaction tree

Take in visual and textual context (semantics).

Make dataset with app overlapping traces.
Use dataset with preprocessing such as RicoSCA or Clay.
Also use accessibility service, as phones are much more powerful.
No need for web interface.
-> Reinforced directly on the phone, more privacy.
